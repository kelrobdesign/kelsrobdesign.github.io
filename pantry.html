								<h1> Patchwork Pantry Redesign </h1>
								<br> 
								<br>
								<br>

								<h2>The <strong class='color' >Task </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
								<p>
											Patchwork Pantry is a nonprofit in the Harrisonburg, VA community which aims to provide days worth of staple food to those in need within the surrounding county. To increase the organization’s online presence and outreach, I took on the task of redesigning the existing website. 

											</p>
							</div>
						<br>
						<br>
							<h2> The <strong class='color' > Original </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
												<img src="img/portfolio/ppog1.png" align="left">
												<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
								<p>
											The existing website lacked a color scheme other than bright colors and did not have an established brandguide. I wanted to work off of the original design and keep the bright colors while refining the organization’s image.  </p>
									<br>
									<p>While the font choice offered legibility, the information was appealing as it was cluttered. The website already had a lot of interesting, relevant information but could benefit from a more coherent layout.  </p>
								
										<br>

											<br>
						<p> With any nonprofit organization, transparency is key to receiving donations. One of the primary requests from the Patchwork Pantry’s Board of Directors was to update the staff page of the website. </p>
							<br>
							<p> Some staff members lacked images or descriptions. To offer consistency, updating all staff member profiles was a must for this redesign project. </p>

										<p> The existing website offered an abundance of information regarding to how to get involved with the organization. While this is important information for any nonprofit to display, the layout could once again be improved to limit the amount of text displayed at one time. </p>

					<h2> The <strong class='color' > Changes </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
										
												<br>


										<h3> A Refined Brand Style Guide</h3>

										<p> To begin, I wanted to ensure the organization had a firm brand which could be translated onto the webpage. I brainstormed and constructed multiple potential style guides with refined color schemes and reported them to board members of the organization. 
 
											<br>
										Ultimately the choice was made by the nonprofit to withhold the design of a logo until a later date. </p>

										<p>The chosen color palette is shown below. </p>
															<br>

												<br>
												<br>
												<br>
										<h3> A Responsive Layout </h3>
										<p> In order to ensure prospective volunteers or people looking to utilize Patchwork Pantry’s services are able to navigate the site, the site was designed to be responsive. The updated site will offer a more suitable configuration for mobile devices than the existing site. Increasing the responsive nature of the site will also improve the pages’ visibility as Google’s search algorithm prioritizes websites that are responsive. </p>
												<br>
												<br>
												<h3> Updated Content </h3>
												<p> Content was also updated. In order to increase transparency, which is especially crucial for nonprofits,I thought it was important to update the preexisting staff page. By updating staff summaries and photos, anyone who visits the site can see the faces behind the organization. Stock photos are being used in place of employee photos in the redesign displayed here both for privacy purposes as well as a delay in receiving updated photos. 
                                                Showcasing the passionate and hard-working members of the organization will help foster an organic personal connection and will hopefully generate more donations. The employee page and the donation page work in unison to build financial transparency and ease of donation. Since people like to know where their money is going, and who is handling their finances, it is crucial the staff page is up to date.</p>
												<br>
												<p> The existing webpage offered a blog, which I helped to curate and update onto the new page. This was likely the most beneficial step in the entirety of the redesign process, as I got a better understanding of the organization while interviewing volunteers. This allowed me to more accurately address the needs of the organization and better render the services offered to the site’s visitors.  </p>

							<h2>The <strong class='color' > Results </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
							<p> For my redesign, I focused on providing a responsive layout as well as further branding with a refined color scheme. I brainstormed and constructed multiple potential style guides and reported them to board members of the organizaiton. Ultimately the choice was made to withhold the design of a logo until a later date. Changes were made to the color palette, fonttypes, and layout. Content was also updated. Stock photos are being used in place of employee photos in the redesign both for privacy purposes as well as a delay in receiving updated photos.   </p>
							<br>
						<br>
			
<p> The redesign has been approved by the organization and is now in the process of being coded. The website should be implemented by summer 2021. Check out some of the redesign mockups!
