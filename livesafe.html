								<br>

								<h2>The <strong class='color' >Task </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
								<p>
											 I took part in a 24 hour design competition. The task for the 2020 competition was, unsurprisingly, to determine a way to slow the spread of COVID-19 across college campuses. Each competitor was given 24 hours to identify a solution to the proposed problem, conduct research, and design a prototype.

											<h4>Brainstorm</h4>
											
											<p>
											In order to stop the spread of Covid-19, many campuses have elected to use the LiveSafe app, and require students to complete a daily health check-in to be allowed on campus. After using the app, I began to notice some pain-points in the design. In an attempt to make the daily check-in process more user-friendly, I decided to redesign the daily check in feature within the LiveSafe app.  
											</p>

								<div class='col-md-4' >
									<div class='service' >
										
										<h2><strong class='color' > 2 </strong></h2>
										
										<div class='content' >
											
											<h4> Design </h4>
											
											<p>
												Given the time constraint of 24 hours, research had to be concise. I analyzed LiveSafe’s user psychographics, as well as the current app’s reviews. I also drew upon my own experiences with the app to determine areas of improvement. I then began wireframing and prototyping the redesign with Adobe XD. 
											</p>

											<h2><strong class='color' > 3 </strong></h2>
										
										<div class='content' >
											
											<h4>Present</h4>
											
											<p>
												At the end of the 24 hour mark, all competitors presented their proposed solution to the task for judging. Since outside help for this project was prohibited, presentations were the first and only opportunity to conduct usability testing. My redesign was chosen as a finalist!

							<div class='content' >
								<br>
								<br>
							<p> Prior to the redesign, users did not have to log into the app. The landing page of the app consisted of four primary options: daily health check in, emergency contact options, the ability to report information, and access to COVID-19 information. There was not color scheme except for the use of primary and secondary colors.</p>
							<br>
							<p> Although the app excelled at functionality, it lacked major design appeal. </p>

							<img src="img/portfolio/task2.png" align="right">

								<br>
								<br>
							<p> To begin the survey, the app requires anyone (students, factuality, affiliates, etc) to put in their email each day, instead of just saving the information. The survey is comprised of 6 questions.</p>
							<br>
							<p> At the end of the survey is a notice informing users that they will receive an email with their results within a few minutes. If the user is showing symptoms, more information will be included within the email. </p>
								</div>

							<div class='content' >
								<br>
								<br>
							<p> Once users have complete the survey, they receive either a confirmation notification granting them access to campus or a denial message urging them to self-isolate. The confirmation screen must be shown to staff in order to enter academic buildings around campus. However, after closing the app, the confirmation message disappears from the app. Users must either re-complete the survey or search through their email to find the confirmation receipt.</p>

<h2>The <strong class='color' > Results </strong></h2>
<br>
									<div class='content' >

							<p> The redesign addresses some of the major pain points of the original check-in process. Users are able to <strong class='color' > save their log-in information </strong> within the app, which eliminates the need for users to input an email and indicate their position as a student or employee of the school. This will help save time, and cut out unnecessary steps for users to complete. </p>
							<br>

<p> By animating the survey process, the daily check-in will <strong class='color' > feel less like a task.</strong> The interaction options mimic that of popular apps today rather than a test format. It also limits the amount of text appearing on the screen at one time to make the appearance less cluttered. </p>
<br>

<p> Finally, having daily results saved within the app reduces users' responsibilities.  Users will no longer have to worry about losing their results within their email inbox. Users can leave the app and be confident that their <strong class='color' >results will still be saved within the app when they return.</strong> This will also help optimize the verification process required to get into campus buildings. Users will spend less time searching for their confirmation and will be able to more quickly show their results, shortening the wait times to get into buildings during rush-hours. </p>
