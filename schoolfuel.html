								<br>
								<h2>The <strong class='color' >Task </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
								<p>
											 I was tasked with developing an e-business plan for a hypothetical business startup that would need to utlize the web and mobile applications to carry out its business objectives. With many school systems transitioning to remote learning as a result of the CoronaVirus, SchoolFuel was designed to help aid overworked teachers, stressed students, and frustrated parents. SchoolFuel is a <strong class='color' >subscription-based </strong> academic resource that provides <strong class='color' > tutoring services </strong> as well as <strong class='color' > study resources</strong> for students k-12 and in undergraduate school. 

											</p>
							</div>
						<br>
						<br>
							<h2> Company <strong class='color' > Background </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
							
								<p>
											SchoolFuel sells a service rather than a product. Through a <strong class='color' > monthly subscription </strong>, SchoolFuel provides academic resources for k-12 and college aged students in the United States. Academic resources include the <strong class='color' >ability to make interactive study guides, virtual flashcards, </strong> as well as have <strong class='color' >individualized tutors. </strong> With the recent CoronaVirus pandemic, schools are forced to close physical buildings and move to an online format. This has added a lot of extra work for educators, disrupted parents’ daily routines, and arguably impeded student learning. According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately 86% of households with incomes of $100,000 or more reported that their children were using online resources for distance learning. In contrast, only 66% of households with incomes less than $50,000 reported that their children were utilizing online resources for school. This may, in part, be due to differing resources among school systems, or differing access to desktop or laptops. In school systems where technology and online resources are not being utilized, SchoolFuel can act as a supplement to the learning process. SchoolFuel aims to provide academic support to students and parents, and hopefully provide relief to overworked teachers by offering a range of free to paid assistance in a student’s learning process. In the future, SchoolFuel would like to expand to cater to the various educational systems found globally, but currently is modeled around the American education system.

									<h2> User <strong class='color' > Demographics </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
								<p>
											The primary user demographic for SchoolFuel is <strong class='color' >students aged 6-22 </strong> in the United States. Eventually SchoolFuel aims to expand to provide services for students across the world, however as a start-up, it is more cost effective to initially cater to a smaller population. Because schools all across America have been impacted by the pandemic, it is hard to determine the location of perspective users. It is likely that users will be from rural, urban, or suburban areas. The hope is that SchoolFuel can assist children whose schools are not currently utilizing online resources, so SchoolFuel’s users will likely come from different economic backgrounds as seen in the aforementioned Census data. Ultimately, SchoolFuel aims to help students of all expertise levels navigate their coursework.

 									<h2> The <strong class='color' > Keyword Analysis </strong></h2>
								<br>
									<div class='content' >
								<p>
											Since SchoolFuel is a new site, it will have to compete among well-established sites when targeting the most popular keyword searches. In order to get SchoolFuel to end up on the search engine result page and save money on ad-clicks, SchoolFuel will aim to optimize relevant keywords with low competition by high monthly searches. To determine which keywords to optimize, general page content was searched for in Google’s Keyword Planner. Search results were filtered by Chegg, as it is the biggest competitor for SchoolFuel. Keywords selected from Google’s keyword tool were then cross-referenced with keywordtool.io which provided search volume and overall trends and competition.

								<p>
											To begin research, <strong class='color' > top of mind awareness </strong> was utilized as it is a strong indicator for which brands have the highest level of awareness for their industry. A survey was conducted via Instagram, asking people (majority of school age) what sites came to mind when thinking of online help for classes. <strong class='color' > Chegg </strong> was voted as thought of first, then <strong class='color' > CourseHero</strong>, followed by <strong class='color' > KhanAcademy </strong> and <strong class='color' > Quizlet </strong>. 
											<br> 
											<br>
											To conduct an analysis of the identified competition, <strong class='color' > Alexa.com </strong> was utilized. This site provides information regarding a site’s comparison metrics, audience overlaps with other sites, keywords breakdowns, the top industry topics by engagement.

								<br>
									<div class='content' >
								<p>
											 I was tasked with developing an e-business plan for a hypothetical business startup that would need to utlize the web and mobile applications to carry out its business objectives. With many school systems transitioning to remote learning as a result of the CoronaVirus, SchoolFuel was designed to help aid overworked teachers, stressed students, and frustrated parents. SchoolFuel is a <strong class='color' >subscription-based </strong> academic resource that provides <strong class='color' > tutoring services </strong> as well as <strong class='color' > study resources</strong> for students k-12 and in undergraduate school. 
								</p>
								<br>
											<ul>
												<li> <strong class='color' >Incorporate Multimedia </strong> Studies have proven that students are more engaged when multimedia is incorporated into their lessons. There is also a proven correlation between the amount of multimedia on a page and the amount of time a visitor spends on a page. To engage students as well as encourage them to spend more time on SchoolFuel, relevant multimedia content such as images, infographics, and videos will be added to pages. All multimedia will be named with a descriptive file name to assist search engines in understanding what the photo is. </li>
												<li> <strong class='color' > Utlize Alt Text </strong> When appropriate, alt text will include the SEO keyphrase of the specific page in which the photo resides. This will help ensure that Google and other search engines can accurately “crawl” and rank the site, which can lead to higher quality traffic to the site. </li>

												<li> <strong class='color' > Compress Images </strong> While images are a necessary component for SchoolFuel, large images can slow down page speed. To combat this, all images on SchoolFuel will be compressed. Kraken.io will be used to optimize any images and infographics to reduce page-load times. By doing so, SchoolFuel pages should take around two to three seconds to load. This will help with both search engine rankings as well as help reduce the bounce rate. Google’s Page Speed insights tool will be utilized to frequently check the site’s overall load speeds. </li>
												<li> <strong class='color' > Ensure Mobile Compatibility </strong> It has been found that users search on Google Images more from mobile devices than desktop devices. Knowing this, SchoolFuel must ensure that the site is accessible on all device types and sizes. Google’s mobile-friendly testing tool will be utilized to determine how well SchoolFuel runs on mobile devices. Google’s mobile compatibility testing tool will also provide feedback on improvements that can be made. </li>
												<li> <strong class='color' > Utilize Link Building </strong> 	It’s fundamental that SchoolFuel makes use of link building as search engines can use links as a recommendation of such. By increasing the amount of high-quality links to SchoolFuel’s site, the chances of being ranked well by search engines will increase. Being ranked higher will help gain more traffic to the site. Referral traffic can also increase from link building. </li>

														The site navigation bar will consist of SchoolFuel’s logo, the homepage, the create page, the search page, the tutors page, and the review page. It also provides a link with the ability to sign up or log in to a users’ profile. The site’s footer consists of an about, press, developers, and privacy. It also provides an arrow which will take users to the top of the site’s page. 
														<br>
<br>
Summaries of the different subscription plans are included on the home page. The summaries consist of the pricing and tools available with each subscription plan. The graphic was also deliberately aligned with the payment plans. The gold-level subscription is under the highest stack of books, and the bronze level subscription is located under the smallest stack of books. This will hopefully subconsciously insinuate to viewers that the gold subscription will lead to the most success, as well as provide the most resources.
